## havener node-exec

Execute command on Kubernetes node

### Synopsis

Execute a command on a node.

This executes a command directly on the node itself. Therefore, havener creates
a temporary pod which enables the user to access the shell of the node. The pod
is deleted automatically afterwards.

The command can be omitted which will result in the default command: [3m/bin/sh[0m. For
example 'havener node-exec foo' will search for a node named 'foo' and open a
shell if found.

Typically, the TTY flag does have to be specified. By definition, if one one
target node is provided, it is assumed that TTY is desired and STDIN is attached
to the remote process. Analog, for the distributed mode with multiple nodes,
no TTY is set and the STDIN is multiplexed into each remote process.

For convenenience, if the target node name [3mall[0m is used, havener will look up
all nodes automatically.



```
havener node-exec [flags] [<node>[,<node>,...]] [<command>]
```
