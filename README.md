## Introducing Havener

If you use a Kubernetes cluster, chances are very high that you use `kubectl` and possibly `helm` a lot. These are fine tools and allow you to do everything you need to do, but there are use cases where you end up with a very long `kubectl` command in your terminal. And this is why we created `havener` to introduce a convenience wrapper around both `kubectl` and `helm`. Think of it as a swiss army knife for Kubernetes tasks. Possible use cases are for example executing a command on multiple pods at the same time, retrieving usage details, or deploying a sequence of Helm Charts with custom pre- and post-install hooks.

## Ok, tell me more

To see a detail list of all havener commands, please refer to the command [documentation](/.docs/commands/havener.md).

Like `kubectl`, `havener` relies on the Kubernetes configuration that can be set via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable. It can also be provided with the `--kubeconfig` flag, which takes the path to the YAML file (for example `$HOME/.kube/config`).

_Please note_: `havener` will use your local `helm` binary, so it is the user reponsability to keep the `helm` binary in sync with tiller.

### Notable Use Cases

> ![havener](.docs/images/havener-top.png?raw=true "Havener terminal screenshot of top command")
> Quickly get a live overview of the current cluster usage details, for example Load, CPU, and Memory of the cluster nodes.

> ![havener](.docs/images/havener-watch.png?raw=true "Havener terminal screenshot of watch command")
> Watch pods in multiple namespaces with added colors to help identify the respective state.

## How do I get started

There are different ways to get `havener`. You are free to pick the one that makes the most sense for your use case.

- On macOS systems, a Homebrew tap is available to install `havener`:

  ```sh
  brew install homeport/tap/havener
  ```

- Use a convenience script to download the latest release to install it in a suitable location on your local machine:

  ```sh
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homeport/havener/master/scripts/download-latest.sh | bash
  ```

- Docker Hub serves curated Docker images with `havener` as well as  `kubectl` and other important CLI tools. There are two flavours available:
  - [Alpine based images](https://hub.docker.com/r/havener/alpine-havener/): `docker pull havener/alpine-havener`
  - [Ubuntu based images](https://hub.docker.com/r/havener/ubuntu-havener/): `docker pull havener/ubuntu-havener`

- Of course, you can also build it from source:

  ```sh
  go get github.com/homeport/havener/cmd/havener
  ```

## Havener Configuration File

A `havener` configuration file provides an easy solution for configurating and deploying one or multiple Helm Charts. The `config` is saved as a YAML file and is used by the `deploy` and `upgrade` commands. Besides information about the charts, it can override the `values.yaml` file and can contain further pre- and post-processing steps. The before and after processing steps support a Concourse style command definition as well as the Travis style with one command per entry.

```yml
name: mongo deployment
releases:
- name: mongodb
  namespace: mongodb
  version: (( env VERSION ))
  location: stable/mongodb
  overrides:
    mongodbUsername: (( env USERNAME ))
    mongodbPassword: (( env PASSWORD ))
    mongodbDatabase: (( env DATABASE ))
  before: [echo "$(date) before release"]
  after: [echo "Installed mongoDB with credentials $USERNAME/$PASSWORD"]

env:
  VERSION: 1
  USERNAME: (( shell echo "user" ))
  PASSWORD: (( secret default root-password password.txt ))
  DATABASE: admin

before:
- cmd: /bin/bash
  args:
  - -c
  - |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "$(date) before deployment"

after:
- echo "$(date) after deployment"
```

### Sections

- `releases` section - Contains a list of all release items which shall be deployed. Hereby, each release contains `general data` about the deployment (name, namespace, version, location of the Chart), an `override section` which can be used for overriding values of the values.yaml file of this Chart, a command to be executed `before` the deployment of this particular release and a command which is executed `after` the release.

- `env` section - Defines new environmental variables which can be used within the configuration file. This enables to build, define and use dynamic values through variables. The values can also contain operators (( ... )) which are resolved before the variable is set. If you're using the `env operator` within this section, you have to make sure that its environmental variable was previously defined.

### Operators

Operators are written in the format `(( <name> <args> ))` and dynamically resolve different expressions during the deployment of the config file. Operators include:

- Operator: `shell` executes and resolves the value of a shell command.
  </br>Usage: `(( shell COMMAND ))`
  </br>Example: `(( shell minikube ip ))`

- Operator: `secret` provides a short-cut solution for retrieving scret values of a namespace.
  </br>Usage: `(( secret NAMESPACE SECRETNAME SECRETKEY ))`
  </br>Example: `(( secret default root-password password.txt ))`

- Operator: `env` provides a short-cut solution for retrieving environmental variables.
  </br>Usage: `(( env ENVIRONMENTAL_VARIABLE_KEY ))`
  </br>Example: `(( env PWD ))`

## Contributing

We are happy to have other people contributing to the project. If you decide to do that, here's how to:

- get Go (`havener` requires Go version 1.13 or greater)
- fork the project
- create a new branch
- make your changes
- open a PR.

Git commit messages should be meaningful and follow the rules nicely written down by [Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):
> The seven rules of a great Git commit message
>
> 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
> 1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
> 1. Capitalize the subject line
> 1. Do not end the subject line with a period
> 1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> 1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
> 1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Running test cases and binaries generation

There are multiple make targets, but running `all` does everything you want in one call.

```sh
make all
```

### Test it with Linux on your macOS system

Best way is to use Docker to spin up a container:

```sh
docker run \
  --interactive \
  --tty \
  --rm \
  --volume $GOPATH/src/github.com/homeport/havener:/go/src/github.com/homeport/havener \
  --workdir /go/src/github.com/homeport/havener \
  golang:1.13 /bin/bash
```

### Package dependencies (Go modules)

The Go module setup can be frustrating, if you have to update Kubernetes API libraries. In general, using `go get` with a specific version based on a tag is known to work, for example `go get k8s.io/client-go@kubernetes-1.16.4`. In case you run into diffculties, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
